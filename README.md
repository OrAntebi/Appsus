# 🗒️ Miss Keep — Note Taking App (Part of Appsus Project)

This repository is part of a larger project called **Appsus**, which includes multiple mini-applications.  
👉 **My personal focus and responsibility within this project is specifically the _Miss-Keep_ app (notes management system).**

Miss Keep is a fully responsive, single-page web application for managing personal notes, inspired by Google Keep.  
Built using **Vanilla React.js**, focusing on a clean UI, flexible note types, and pixel-perfect responsive design.
